            <h2>Assistance With Daily Life Tasks In A Group Or Shared Living Arrangement</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem">We provide assistance with and/or supervising tasks of daily life in a
                shared living environment, which
                is either temporary or ongoing, with a focus on developing your skills to live as autonomously as
                possible. This includes short-term accommodation and assistance (e.g. respite care).</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem">We work under Supported Independent Living (SIL) arrangement to supervise
                your daily life tasks while in
                a shared living environment. The aim of SIL is to help you develop and build your individual skills
                and
                empower you to live as independently as possible. This service is available to anyone living in a
                private rental, whether it's with others or by yourself.</p>
